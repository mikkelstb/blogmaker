# Blogmaker

Blogmaker is a minimalistic blog application. No database or webserver required. It is written in go as a standalone application, and uses the filesystem as backend. As of February 2022 it has the following features:

- Frontpage with posts ordered by publication dates, as well as "cards", which act as a set of static sidebars.
- Individual dages for posts
- Tags are shown on frontpage
- Search page for tags

Work is under construction.

An example of the program, is running as my own personal blog at http://misb.xyz/blog.
